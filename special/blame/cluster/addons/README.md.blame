0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Cluster add-ons are resources like Services and Deployments (with pods) that are
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	shipped with the Kubernetes binaries and are considered an inherent part of the
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Kubernetes clusters.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	There are currently two classes of add-ons:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Add-ons that will be reconciled.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Add-ons that will be created if they don't exist.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	More details could be found in [addon-manager/README.md](addon-manager/README.md).

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	## Cooperating Horizontal / Vertical Auto-Scaling with "reconcile class addons"
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	"Reconcile" class addons will be periodically reconciled to the original state given
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	by the initial config. In order to make Horizontal / Vertical Auto-scaling functional,
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	the related fields in config should be left unset. More specifically, leave `replicas`
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	in `ReplicationController` / `Deployment` / `ReplicaSet` unset for Horizontal Scaling,
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	leave `resources` for container unset for Vertical Scaling. The periodic reconcile
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	won't clobbered these fields, hence they could be managed by Horizontal / Vertical
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Auto-scaler.

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	## Add-on naming
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	The suggested naming for most of the resources is `<basename>` (with no version number).
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Though resources like `Pod`, `ReplicationController` and `DaemonSet` are exceptional.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	It would be hard to update `Pod` because many fields in `Pod` are immutable. For
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	`ReplicationController` and `DaemonSet`, in-place update may not trigger the underlying
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	pods to be re-created. You probably need to change their names during update to trigger
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	a complete deletion and creation.
