0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	This repository contains utilities for efficiently performing Win32 IO operations in
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Go. Currently, this is focused on accessing named pipes and other file handles, and
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	for using named pipes as a net transport.

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	This code relies on IO completion ports to avoid blocking IO on system threads, allowing Go
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	to reuse the thread to schedule another goroutine. This limits support to Windows Vista and
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	newer operating systems. This is similar to the implementation of network sockets in Go's net
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	package.
