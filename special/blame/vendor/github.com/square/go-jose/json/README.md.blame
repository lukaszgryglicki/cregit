0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	The following changes were made:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	* Object deserialization uses case-sensitive member name matching instead of
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  [case-insensitive matching](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/json/current/msg03763.html).
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  This is to avoid differences in the interpretation of JOSE messages between
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  go-jose and libraries written in other languages.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	* When deserializing a JSON object, we check for duplicate keys and reject the
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  input whenever we detect a duplicate. Rather than trying to work with malformed
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  data, we prefer to reject it right away.
