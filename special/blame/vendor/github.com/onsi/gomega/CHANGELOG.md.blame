0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Improvements:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Added `BeSent` which attempts to send a value down a channel and fails if the attempt blocks.  Can be paired with `Eventually` to safely send a value down a channel with a timeout.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `立`, `Expect`, `Eventually`, and `Consistently` now immediately `panic` if there is no registered fail handler.  This is always a mistake that can hide failing tests.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `Receive()` no longer errors when passed a closed channel, it's perfectly fine to attempt to read from a closed channel so 立(c).Should(Receive()) always fails and 立(c).ShoudlNot(Receive()) always passes with a closed channel.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Added `HavePrefix` and `HaveSuffix` matchers.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `ghttp` can now handle concurrent requests.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Added `Succeed` which allows one to write `立(MyFunction()).Should(Succeed())`.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Improved `ghttp`'s behavior around failing assertions and panics:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	    - If a registered handler makes a failing assertion `ghttp` will return `500`.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	    - If a registered handler panics, `ghttp` will return `500` *and* fail the test.  This is new behavior that may cause existing code to break.  This code is almost certainly incorrect and creating a false positive.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `ghttp` servers can take an `io.Writer`.  `ghttp` will write a line to the writer when each request arrives.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Added `WithTransform` matcher to allow munging input data before feeding into the relevant matcher
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Added boolean `And`, `Or`, and `Not` matchers to allow creating composite matchers
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Bug Fixes:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- gexec: `session.Wait` now uses `EventuallyWithOffset` to get the right line number in the failure.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `ContainElement` no longer bails if a passed-in matcher errors.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	## 1.0 (8/2/2014)
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	No changes. Dropping "beta" from the version number.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	## 1.0.0-beta (7/8/2014)
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Breaking Changes:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Changed OmegaMatcher interface.  Instead of having `Match` return failure messages, two new methods `FailureMessage` and `NegatedFailureMessage` are called instead.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Moved and renamed OmegaFailHandler to types.GomegaFailHandler and OmegaMatcher to types.GomegaMatcher.  Any references to OmegaMatcher in any custom matchers will need to be changed to point to types.GomegaMatcher
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	New Test-Support Features:

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	    - Makes it easy to send signals and wait for processes to exit
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	    - Provides an `Exit` matcher to assert against exit code.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	DSL Changes:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `Eventually` and `Consistently` can accept `time.Duration` interval and polling inputs.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- The default timeouts for `Eventually` and `Consistently` are now configurable.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	New Matchers:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `ConsistOf`: order-independent assertion against the elements of an array/slice or keys of a map.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `BeTemporally`: like `BeNumerically` but for `time.Time`
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `HaveKeyWithValue`: asserts a map has a given key with the given value.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Updated Matchers:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- `Receive` matcher can take a matcher as an argument and passes only if the channel under test receives an objet that satisfies the passed-in matcher.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Matchers that implement `MatchMayChangeInTheFuture(actual interface{}) bool` can inform `Eventually` and/or `Consistently` when a match has no chance of changing status in the future.  For example, `Receive` returns `false` when a channel is closed.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Misc:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Start using semantic versioning

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- Pull out Gomega's internal to `internal`
