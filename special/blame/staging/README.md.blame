0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Most code in the `staging/` directory is authoritative, i.e. the only copy of
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	the code. You can directly modify such code. However the packages in
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	`staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/pkg` are copied from `pkg/`. If you modify the
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	original code in `pkg/`, you need to run `hack/godep-restore.sh` from the k8s
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	root directory, followed by `hack/update-staging-client-go.sh`. We are working
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	towards making all code in `staging/` authoritative.

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	The `vendor/k8s.io` directory contains symlinks pointing to this staging area,
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	so to use a package in the staging area, you can import it as
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	`k8s.io/<package-name>`, as if the package were vendored. Packages will be
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	vendored from `k8s.io/<package-name>` for real after the test matrix is
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	converted to vendor k8s components.
