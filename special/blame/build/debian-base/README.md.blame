0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	The Kubernetes debian-base image provides a common base for Kubernetes system images that require
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	external dependencies (such as `iptables`, `sh`, or anything that is more than a static go-binary).

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	This image differs from the standard debian image by removing a lot of packages and files that are
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	generally not necessary in containers. The end result is an image that is just over 40 MB, down from
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	123 MB.

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	The image also provides a convenience script `/usr/local/bin/clean-install` that encapsulates the
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	process of updating apt repositories, installing the packages, and then cleaning up unnecessary
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	caches & logs.
