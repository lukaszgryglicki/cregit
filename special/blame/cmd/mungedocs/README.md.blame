0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	Basically this is like lint/gofmt for md docs.

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	It basically does the following:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- iterate over all files in the given doc root.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- for each file split it into a slice (mungeLines) of lines (mungeLine)
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- a mungeline has metadata about each line typically determined by a 'fast' regex.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  - metadata contains things like 'is inside a preformatted block'
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  - contains a markdown header
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  - has a link to another file
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  - etc..
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  - if you have a really slow regex with a lot of backtracking you might want to write a fast one to limit how often you run the slow one.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- each munger is then called in turn
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  - they are given the mungeLines
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  - they create an entirely new set of mungeLines with their modifications
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	  - the new set is returned
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- the new set is then fed into the next munger.
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;;	- in the end we might commit the end mungeLines to the file or not (--verify)
